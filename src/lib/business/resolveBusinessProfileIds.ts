/**
 * R1 — canonical branded bidirectional business↔profile id mapping.
 *
 * This module is the SOLE business↔profile id resolver. It was introduced in
 * PR-0 as a thin re-brand that delegated to the legacy role-blind
 * `resolveBusinessIds`; in PR-4 the implementation moved here and the legacy
 * file became a `@deprecated` shim, and in the R1 cleanup that shim was deleted
 * outright once every caller had migrated. There is exactly ONE implementation —
 * this one — so the two id-spaces can never silently drift.
 *
 * Behaviour is preserved verbatim from the original resolver, with ONE
 * deliberate change in R1 PR-6 (see below):
 *   - two `business_profiles` lookups (by `business_id`, then by `id`),
 *   - the input-echo fallback for unresolvable ids (kept until R14's data
 *     cleanse; see below),
 *   - the load-bearing `all` ordering for `.in('business_id', …)` money queries.
 *
 * R1 PR-6 — module-level memo removed. The legacy resolver carried a
 * process-level `Map` that was never invalidated: a warm serverless instance
 * could serve a stale id pair indefinitely (e.g. after a business_profiles row
 * is created or repaired), and it grew unbounded across the process lifetime.
 * Each resolution is a single indexed PK/FK lookup against `business_profiles`,
 * and call sites invoke the resolver once per request, so the cache bought
 * almost nothing while creating warm-vs-cold nondeterminism. It is now gone —
 * every call resolves fresh.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: the input-echo fallback is preserved on purpose. For a tenant whose
 * stored `business_id` is a polluted wrong-id-class value, this keeps money
 * reads degrading to "no rows" instead of throwing. Do not stricten it here —
 * write-side strictness is enforced separately by `assertBusinessProfileId`
 * (`sync-orchestrator.ts`).
 *
 * The branded `{ businessId, profileId }` shape gives callers TypeScript
 * protection against the `businesses.id` ⇄ `business_profiles.id` ⇄ `user.id`
 * confusion (the #1 incident class). This is the only resolver — all code
 * imports THIS function.
